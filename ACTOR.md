## Why YouPorn Downloader

YouPorn pages can expose multiple player assets and quality variants, which makes generic download tools inconsistent. A quick scan often picks up the wrong file or misses the active stream once playback is initialized.

YouPorn Downloader is built to reduce that friction. Start the video, let the extension detect the supported media source, choose the quality you want, and export the result as MP4 from inside the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported YouPorn media from active watch pages
- Multi-source detection covering mediaDefinitions, nested API fetch, and inline scripts
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Converts HLS streams to standard MP4 files in-browser
- Lists available quality variants when present
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Exports MP4 files for simpler replay and archiving
- Auto-saves to an organized YouPorn subfolder in Downloads
- Uses a browser-only workflow with no extra software
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

2. Open a YouPorn video page and start playback.
3. Let the extension detect the active media source.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button on the player.
5. Select the quality you want from the available resolutions.
6. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
7. Save the finished file locally.

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect the video**  
Start playback first and wait for the page to initialize the active source.

**Only one source is listed**  
Some pages expose only one usable stream, so only one option may appear.

**The wrong source appears**
Refresh the page and retry after playback starts again.

**The download failed partway through**
Check your connection and refresh the page before starting again.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.

## Installation Instructions

1. Open the latest release page: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/serpxxx/youporn-video-downloader/releases/latest)
2. Download the correct build for your browser.
3. Install the extension.
4. Open a YouPorn watch page.
5. Use the popup to detect and download the media.

## FAQ

**Can I download YouPorn videos as MP4?**  
Yes. Supported downloads are exported as MP4 files.

**Do I need extra software?**  
No. The workflow stays inside the browser extension.

**Will it work on every page?**
It works on supported playback flows. Detection depends on how the active page exposes the media source.

**Where are videos saved?**
They are saved to your default Downloads location, typically inside a YouPorn subfolder.

**Is my data safe?**
Yes. Video processing happens entirely in your browser. Authentication uses secure OTP with no passwords stored.
